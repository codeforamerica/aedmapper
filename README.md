AED Mapper
===============================

A crowdsourcing app for AEDs (defibrillators)

The ingredients consist of:
- A web interface for submitting AED locations
- A email gateway that anyone can email photos to from their smartphone
- Some EXIF parsing and email reply magic that tries to place AEDs on a map and encourages to manually improve accuracy

Work in progress -- more info soon
